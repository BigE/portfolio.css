                  Portfolio is a project I started to simply help showcase my
                  own abilities, to give me a space to work out of, and a way to
                  learn new technologies. After putting more development effort
                  into it, this project will become a way to create and manage
                  your resume, as well as an area to built and showcase any
                  projects.

                  DeskChanger is a gnome-shell extension written in JavaScript
                  and python using gjs for integration to GTK. The extension is
                  a wallpaper slideshow with support for multiple profiles that
                  can be switched on the fly.

                  Python daemon provides all functionality to load the current
                  profile and automatically change wallpapers on the interval
                  specified. When loading the profile, the daemon will load
                  folders recursively and validate that the files being loaded
                  are images. Daemon also has the ability to enable DBUS server
                  for interaction with the extension.
